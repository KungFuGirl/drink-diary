# DRINK DIARY

### What is “Drink Diary”?

It’s an app that allows you to document your personal wine, whiskey or may be craft soda journey and helps you to discover your palate preferences. For those, who love to try new things, but never remembers what they have just tried. 

### The Purpose:

This project has three main purposes: 
1. become an app we feel is really lacking in our lives,
2. be our “Breakable toy”,
3. save trees (finally replace that notebook that you carry with you trying to remember to write down the things you tried). 

Building “Drink Diary” is our fun way to learn new technology, face challenging design decisions,  break things, fix things, discover new unexpected bugs in Rails 5 and all things JavaScript, contribute based on our experience to open source (mainly by declaring issues, reporting bugs and sometimes by providing solutions to the same bugs other people faces in case if we’re able to solve them), keep coding, and become a better developer at the end of the day.

### Concept and philosophy behind the “Drink Diary”

There are many apps out there that allows you to rate things. When it comes to drinks, most of the times, those apps are dedicated to one type of drink. You can find the wine, rate it, review it and move on. The only problem with it… those apps are about evaluating the wine, the brand of whiskey, the work of the winemaker. Its all about them, not you.

“Drink Diary” is not a typical post and share reviews app. It’a your personal diary, your personal journey. It’s not about them, it’s about you, your drink journey, your taste and your preferences. It allows you to store the informations about wines you tried, rate them, write notes, even add photos. The trick is, this information is available only to you. Ratings you give are not used to evaluate the brand based on opinions from different users. Those ratings, reviews, and notes are there to remind you if you like this whiskey or not, what you didn’t like about this soda, or may be bring up fun memories that will pop up in your head once you see the picture you attached to that bottle of wine that you drank on the boat with your best friend that just flew in from Canada for a weekend. 

End goal is to be able not just document your wine, whiskey, coffee or any other type of drink journey, but being able to create user taste profile. Our app will be able to help you on that Tuesday evening, when you are on your way to a dinner after a long difficult day at work, you stop by the store to pick up a bottle of wine and you have no mental force to think, what to buy… You will open the “Drink Diary” and pull up your taste preferences profile and see, that your average rating for Rieslings from WA state is 4.9, or to see which wines you rated at 5, and just grab the bottle of wine that you will enjoy (almost certainly). Because sometimes, even though you are an adventurous person who loves to try new things, you just want to have a glass of wine and enjoy it, without being disappointed.  

### Learning:

While building this application, we wanted to try out technologies that we’re uncomfortable with in an effort to learn them or discover the latest versions of the technology we used to work with. This is an ongoing list of things we are implementing:

* Rails 5 - new, fresh and not yet discovered
* EmberJs - exciting new technology that is young, but powerful
* How to make a Ruby Rails API app with Emberjs
* Passing customs formatted JSON between APIs
* Working with complex data modeling 

### Status:

On Aug 30 2016 we set down to discuss the concept of the app that we really miss. Now we are working on our first release that is focused on documenting your personal wine journey.
